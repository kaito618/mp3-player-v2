HAD THE IDEA AT 2025/12/30 1.40 pm filtered the idea and was ready to start working at 3 pm had a break (sleeping) to 7 pm and then i started diving into the schematics world for the first time at 7 pm 

made my first project at 7:40 pm after some yt toturials on how to use EasyEDA

THE project is a v2 of the mp3 player i made this time i want it to be smaller and with my own pcp and would like to try some 3d modeling for the first time too with the enclosure

i finsihed the charging + protection circuit at 8:40 pm 

did some research on the ics and the parts im using and figured out which parts to choose and added them at 11:30 pm +(more easyeda tuts)

i'm going to connect the some other parts and modify the mp3 player board for my needs and then have a break (sleep) cuz i'm sick now its 11:53 

i'll keep working now 11:58 pm

-----------------------------------
now its 1:30 am what i finished my research about the mp3 boards and choose the right one for my needs and i made a project on blueprint hackclub under the name mp3 player v2 to journal and keep track of time and for the project i will finsih journaling this part first on the site and i already started considering the bluetooth option and im having some problems with how to add it because i want it to be toggled on and off on need to save battery my current idea is adding a separate bl moudle board and connecting it to the switch 
ill finsih the journal first and then i'll decide whether to sleep or continue
done 
charging module + protection , (battarey added 1500 mAH for now ) , added type c connector 3.1 acn wired everything , chose which mp3 board ill use and added it still didnt connect it 1:39 am
-----------------------------------
i've alr done the first jornal on hackclub and went eda again i tried wiring the parts that i chose for now and was super confused on how to connect them i'm not used to the schematic type of thing (my first time) i was lost between letters and wires and accidantly connecting parts becuase of the grid thing that the wire isn't flexible had to go watch more tutorials and learn the abbreviations of the pins and then i finally managed to wire al the parts i didnt totally finish the wiring procces, i still need to add some ressistors and capacitors and the bluetotth module but i guess thats enough for today becuase i nedd to sleep and rest 
# time now 3:24 
done 
most of wiring for the parts (TP4056X-435-ESOP8) (DW01A) (FS8205A) (USB3.1 TYPE-C 06PF-073) (GPD2856C) (battery)
