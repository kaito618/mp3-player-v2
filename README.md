HAD THE IDEA AT 2025/12/30 1.40 pm filtered the idea and was ready to start working at 3 pm had a break (sleeping) to 7 pm and then i started diving into the schematics world for the first time at 7 pm 

made my first project at 7:40 pm after some yt toturials on how to use EasyEDA

THE project is a v2 of the mp3 player i made this time i want it to be smaller and with my own pcb and would like to try some 3d modeling for the first time too with the enclosure

i finsihed the charging + protection circuit at 8:40 pm 

did some research on the ics and the parts im using and figured out which parts to choose and added them at 11:30 pm +(more easyeda tuts)

i'm going to connect the some other parts and modify the mp3 player board for my needs and then have a break (sleep) cuz i'm sick now its 11:53 

i'll keep working now 11:58 pm

-----------------------------------
now its 1:30 am what i finished my research about the mp3 boards and choose the right one for my needs and i made a project on blueprint hackclub under the name mp3 player v2 to journal and keep track of time and for the project i will finsih journaling this part first on the site and i already started considering the bluetooth option and im having some problems with how to add it because i want it to be toggled on and off on need to save battery my current idea is adding a separate bl moudle board and connecting it to the switch 
ill finsih the journal first and then i'll decide whether to sleep or continue
done 
charging module + protection , (battarey added 1500 mAH for now ) , added type c connector 3.1 acn wired everything , chose which mp3 board ill use and added it still didnt connect it 1:39 am
-----------------------------------
i've alr done the first jornal on hackclub and went eda again i tried wiring the parts that i chose for now and was super confused on how to connect them i'm not used to the schematic type of thing (my first time) i was lost between letters and wires and accidantly connecting parts becuase of the grid thing that the wire isn't flexible had to go watch more tutorials and learn the abbreviations of the pins and then i finally managed to wire al the parts i didnt totally finish the wiring procces, i still need to add some ressistors and capacitors and the bluetotth module but i guess thats enough for today becuase i nedd to sleep and rest 
----------------------------------
# time now 3:24 
done 
most of wiring for the parts (TP4056X-435-ESOP8) (DW01A) (FS8205A) (USB3.1 TYPE-C 06PF-073) (GPD2856C) (battery)

i'm having some problems with the wiring process on easyeda especially after changing some goals as for now i got this idea to charge and add the files through the same type c port instead of manually adding files to sd card
problems
1- i need a different type of type c connector and i choose a one with 16 pins
2- i need to wire the new type c
3- some of my wires are connected in a wrong way and i need to rewire them
4- i don't seem to fully understand the wiring system on easyeda like the circle and whether the pins are connected or not
5- delayed the bluetooth part until i finish the wiring for those parts

lunch break at 3:43 pm

i changed the whole approach and changed some parts, i replaced the (TP4056X-435-ESOP8) (DW01A) (FS8205A) with the TP5400_C2891434 to have less parts on screen and to improve have smaller size finale, i restarted the whole project made a new project on easyeda and started adding the parts with the new modifications finished choosing the new parts and adding them at 6:46 pm
![sev2 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f487ac1-7521-48b6-af4b-b5b10bed7500)


i then started wiring the parts and connecting everything and finished wiring at 7:40 pm
![sec2 1 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/181854d3-6bd1-4253-9e11-9684171c4a5f)


i had some problems with connecting the 3.5 mm jack didn't k which pin was for what and discovered the gnd flag feature which made everything much easier than my first approach
now its 7:53 i'll probably have a break and then go on and
recheck the wiring i alr did and connecting the floating labeled wires i didn't connect yet

-------------------------------
almost finished the schematic
i'll go on until i reach the pcb layout part (prob) (at 11:59 pm 2025/12/31) start time
i have finished the schematic but still need to ask someone who knows about pcb if i did it right before doing next part (convert to pcb) i had ton of problems and used wrong datasheet for the old parts i was using instead of the new ones i added so i messed up almost all the connections and then when i finally noticed i had to delete and rewire the whole thing again for like the millionth time i will probably loose my sanity after this project lol but i don't plan on stopping even if it i don't manage to make it real at least i did and learned a lotttt

this was the first wiring

![first](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05c347de-b917-482a-bc1b-8d73b55498da)


and this is the final one for now and hope it's good (cuz i'm so close of being one with my chair)

done at 1:25 am 2026/1/1 (i've been working on this project for a whole year lol)
--------------------------------
at 2 am i got some information that the main ic i'm using won't be available so i have to choose the gpd ic and the ic i chose was the AC6965E4 and now i need to reconnect everything again i'll try to keep my sanity and do the whole thing before i sleep unless my back decides to collapse first.
see ya i'll start now 2:27 am
i've connected the new ic finally did some modifications and connected the new features of the ac6 ic as blutooth and rewired the button system, 3 buttons instead of 4 to lower cost i have finished the connections at 3:37 am
