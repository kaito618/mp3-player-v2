HAD THE IDEA AT 2025/12/30 1.40 pm filtered the idea and was ready to start working at 3 pm had a break (sleeping) to 7 pm and then i started diving into the schematics world for the first time at 7 pm 

made my first project at 7:40 pm after some yt toturials on how to use EasyEDA

THE project is a v2 of the mp3 player i made this time i want it to be smaller and with my own pcp and would like to try some 3d modeling for the first time too with the enclosure

i finsihed the charging + protection circuit at 8:40 pm 

did some research on the ics and the parts im using and figured out which parts to choose and added them at 11:30 pm +(more easyeda tuts)

i'm going to connect the some other parts and modify the mp3 player board for my needs and then have a break (sleep) cuz i'm sick now its 11:53 

i'll keep working now 11:58 pm
